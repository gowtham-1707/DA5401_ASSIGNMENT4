# DA5401 Assignment 4: GMM-Based Synthetic Sampling for Imbalanced Data

## Overview
This project focuses on addressing class imbalance in datasets using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for synthetic sampling. The goal is to improve the performance of machine learning models on imbalanced datasets by generating synthetic samples for the minority class.

## Objectives
- Understand the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.
- Implement GMM for generating synthetic samples.
- Evaluate the performance of models trained on the original and synthetic data.

## Tasks
1. **Data Loading and Analysis**: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to understand class distribution and identify any data quality issues.
2. **Baseline Model Training and Evaluation**: Train a baseline model on the original imbalanced dataset and evaluate its performance.
3. **GMM Implementation**: Implement Gaussian Mixture Models to model the minority class and generate synthetic samples.
4. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use the GMM to create synthetic samples and combine them with the original dataset.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Train and evaluate models on the augmented dataset and compare their performance with the baseline model.

## Submission Guidelines
- Submit the Jupyter Notebook (`DA5401_Assignment_4_GMM_Sampling.ipynb`) containing all code, visualizations, and explanations.
- Ensure that the notebook is well-documented and includes comments for clarity.
- Include this README file in your submission.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Completeness of the implementation and adherence to the project objectives.
- Quality of the analysis and visualizations.
- Clarity and organization of the Jupyter Notebook.
- Performance improvement of the model after applying GMM-based synthetic sampling.
